# Dataset Introduction

The Dataset gave the opinion of a number of different sweets by a sample 
of the population from various countries across the world.

I've made the assumption that all the items in '[]' were indeed sweets in the
'15 & '16 data sets as were those items for Q6 in the '17 data set.
Also in the '15 data set gender, country were not recorded, so they've have been
included as 'NA'.  The age of participants varied considerably with some clearly
fictious values provided. Therefore only ages from 0-99 were included in any 
age-related calculations, others were set to 'NA'.  Countries were considered as
America, Canada, UK or other, where a specific country was required,
therefore all countries not considered one of the inital three as placed in a 
larger 'bucket'.


The steps to clean the data, with appropriate comments, are provided in a
separate script.
